Now, you can use the **Gowebly** CLI without installation. Just run it with [`go run`][go_run_url] to create a new project:

### The learning path

It's highly recommended to start exploring with short articles "[**What is Gowebly CLI?**](https://gowebly.org/getting-started)" and "[**How does it work?**](https://gowebly.org/getting-started/how-does-it-work)" to understand the basic principle and the main components built into the **Gowebly** CLI.

Next steps are:

1. [Install the CLI to your system](https://gowebly.org/complete-user-guide/installation)

## üéØ Motivation to create

Tell me, how often have you had to start a new project from scratch and had to make painful manual configurations? ü§î Especially, when you are just getting acquainted with a new technology or stack, where everything is new to you.

For many developers, _including me_, this process is as tedious and even depressing as possible, and doesn't carry any useful workload. It is a **very** frustrating process that can push any developer away from technology a lot.

Why not just give all that awful manual work to machines? Let them do all the hard work for us, and we will just create awesome web products and not have to think about build and deploy.

That's why the **Gowebly** CLI was born. It allows you to start a new project faster with **Go**, **htmx**, **hyperscript** or **Alpine.js**, **Templ** and the most popular **CSS** frameworks.

I am here to save you from this routine pain! ‚ú®
